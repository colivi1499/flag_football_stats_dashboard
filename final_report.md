# Project Overview

## Summary
<!-- One to three sentences describing the project -->
  This project is a web app for tracking flag football stats. When users create an account, they can create their own leagues to manage with the ability to add teams, players, record games and player stats.
  League managers can add other users as collaborators so they can also manage the league.
